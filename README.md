# Bert-and-multimodal-model-for-visuel-contextuel-text-classification
This project implements a cross-attention-based architecture to enhance BERT with visual features extracted from a Vision Transformer (ViT). The model classifies sentences (and tokens) from artwork-related texts as either visual (about the painting) or contextual (about external knowledge), without requiring the image at inference.
